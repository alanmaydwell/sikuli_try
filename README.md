# Trying out SikuliX
http://sikulix.com/

Trying out SikuliX with two Oracle Forms based applications, CWA and CCMS.


## SikuliX scripts

### CWA_try.sikuli
Simple script that works with CWA Oracle Forms

### CCMS_try.sikuli
Simple script that works with CCMS Oracle Forms

### CCMS_repeat_search.sikuli
Completes repeated case searches in CCMS

### ccms_new.sikuli
Also completes reapeated case searches in CCMS. Also uses screenshots in separate directories using home-made way of setting the paths.

### ccms_better_paths.sikuli
Another one that completes case searches in CCMS and has screenshots in separate directories. This time uses SikuliX's built in image path handling (getImagePath, addImagePath, removeImagePath).

### ccms_modular.sikuli
Another CCMS script. This one tries to be more modular.
